SITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION: https://rami-islam-pages.github.io/Important-Lessons-for-the-Muslim-Ummah-Interactive/

This is a big task, but I hope to turn the work of Sheikh Haytham Sarhan's حفظه الله explanation of The Important Lessons for the Muslim Ummah of Sheikh Bin Baz رحمه الله

أسأل الله أن يبارك فيه وينفع به الأمة.

I ask Allah to put barakah in it and make it a means of benefit for the ummah.

I had the idea to make a site from this book of Sheikh Bin Baz رحمه الله many months ago, but I began coding the site 11/14/2025.
