                <p>Allah says: "And the Messenger has said, 'O my Lord, surely my people have abandoned this Qur'an" (Qur'an 25:30). The Prophet –may Allah praise and send him peace- has said: "From the offspring of this person will come people who will read the Qur'an, but it does not pass their throat (i.e. they do not understand it). They kill the Muslims and leave alone the idol worshipers. They will leave Islam just as an arrow passes through the target. If I reach them, I will kill them as the people of 'Aad were killed" (Bukhari 3610 and Muslim 1064).</p>

                </div>
                
                <p><strong>1.</strong> In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. <strong>2.</strong> All praise and thanks are only for Allah, the Lord of everything that exists. <strong>3.</strong> The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. <strong>4.</strong> The Owner of the Day of Judgement. <strong>5.</strong> You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help. <strong>6.</strong> Guide us to the straight path. <strong>7.</strong> The path of those whom You have blessed and not the path of those who angered You nor of those who are lost.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(1)</strong> This means: I begin with every Name of Allah, the Most High. This is since the word "Name" is singular and in the genitive form; therefore, it includes all of Allah's Beautiful and Perfect Names. "Allah", He is the God who is worshipped: the one deserving worship to the exclusion of everything else because of His qualities of divinity, all of which are perfect. "The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful". These are two Names proving that He, Most High, is one who possesses a great and all-encompassing mercy that covers everything and includes every living being. He has decreed it for those who obey Allah, those who follow His Prophets and Messengers: these have unrestricted mercy. Everyone else has a portion of this mercy. Know that one of the principles agreed upon by the early scholars of Islam and their Imams is to have faith in Allah and His Attributes, and in the rules determining how they are to be understood. So, for example, they believe that he is the Entirely Merciful and the Especially Merciful; possessing the quality of mercy which is extended to its recipients.</p>
                
                <p>Therefore, all blessings are from the results of this mercy. This principle holds true for all of His Names. It is said concerning the Name, All-Knowing: He is All-Knowing, possessing the quality of knowledge by which He knows everything. He is All-Capable, possessing the quality of ability which makes Him capable of doing anything.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(2)</strong> "All praise and thanks is only for Allah", this verse praises Allah with His perfect Attributes and His actions, all of which are based upon beneficence and justice. To Him belongs perfect and complete praise in every sense. "Lord of the worlds", the Lord is the One who nourishes and sustains the whole of the creation, meaning everything besides Allah, by the very fact of His creating them, His preparing for them the means, and Him blessing them with immense blessings, the absence of which would make their existence impossible. Thus, every blessing they possess, it is from Him, the Most High. His sustaining of the creation is of two types: general and specific. The general refers to His creating the creation, providing for them, and guiding them to all that they need in order to survive in this worldly life. The specific refers to His sustaining His sincere slaves with faith, guiding them to submit to it, perfecting and completing it for them, keeping away everything which may affect it. The reality of this is: Guiding them to every good and protecting them from all evil. Perhaps it was due to this that most of the supplications made by the prophets used the word 'Rabb': all they requested was covered by His specific lordship. His saying "Lord of the worlds"; He alone is the Creator and that all affairs are regulated by Him as is the provision of blessings. It also proves that He is completely Rich Beyond Need and that creation is in total and dire need of Him alone in every sense and in every possible way.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(4)</strong> "Owner of the Day of Judgement". The master is a person who has the quality of ownership, from the consequences of which is the ability to command and prohibit, reward and punish, and to behave with his subjects and possessions in any way he wishes. The Master of the Day of Judgement, the Day of Rising, the Day on which man will be judged for his actions the good and the bad. This is because on that day the completeness and perfection of His mastery, justice, and wisdom will be made clear to all. Moreover, it will be the end of the worldly masters, so much so that kings, ministers, slaves and the free-born will all be the same: all of them submissive to His greatness, rendered in complete submission before His honor, expectant of His recompense, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment. The point of mentioning His mastery in this context is to emphasize it; otherwise, He is Master of the Day of Judgement and all other days. <strong>5)</strong> "You Alone we worship and You Alone we ask for help", meaning that we single You out alone for worship and seeking help. This is because mentioning the object at the head of a verb is a method of constraint (hasr), i.e. affirming what is mentioned in the sentence and negating it for anything that falls outside. Therefore, it is as if the person has said, we worship You and we do not worship anything else. We ask You for help and we do not turn to anyone else for help.'</p>
                
                <p>Mentioning worship before asking for help is by way of mentioning the general before the specific, and to show that attention should be given to His right over the right of His slave. Worship is "a collective noun that subsumes all actions and sayings, outward and inward, that Allah loves and is pleased with. Seeking help, isti`ana, is "to depend upon Allah, Most High, in acquiring that which would benefit and repressing that which would harm, along with having the certainty that He will actually assist the one asking".</p>
                
                <p>Establishing the worship of Allah and seeking His help are the means to everlasting happiness and security from all evil; there is no path to victory except by meeting the requirements of these two pillars. Worship can only be considered to be true worship when done in the way taught by the Messenger seeking thereby only Allah's Face. These two conditions have to be present for the action to be considered worship. Seeking help has been mentioned after worship even though it is a part of worship because the slave is always in need of Allah's help in all acts of worship: if Allah does not help him, he will not achieve the goals he hopes to attain by enacting the obligations and avoiding the prohibitions. <strong>(6)</strong> "Guide us to and on the Straight Path" means show us, direct us to it, and grant us the divine grace to traverse it. The Straight Path is the clear path that leads to Allah and His Paradise: it is the knowing the truth and acting by it. Therefore, the verse means: guide us to the Path and guide us in the Path. Guidance to the Path means to come to Islam and abandon all other religions. Guidance in the Path means guidance towards all of the details of Islam in terms of knowledge and action. Hence, this supplication is one of the most comprehensive and most beneficial supplications, and this is why it is obligatory to supplicate to Allah with it in every unit of prayer, especially since the servant is in continuous need of it. <strong>(7)</strong> This Straight Path is "the Path of those You have blessed" who are the Prophets, the Sincerely Truthful, the Martyrs and the Righteous "not" the path "of those who have incurred anger" who knew the truth but abandoned it such as the Jews and others, "nor" the path "of those astray" who abandoned the truth out of ignorance and misguidance such as the Christians.</p>
                
                <p>This chapter, despite being short, has covered what no other chapter of the Qur´an has. It mentions the three types of Tawhid: Tawhid al-Rububiyyah, (Oneness of Allah's Lordship), derived from His saying, "Lord of all the worlds"; Tawhid al-Ilaahiyyah, (Oneness of Worship), which is to single out Allah Alone for worship, derived from the word "Allah" and from His saying "You Alone we worship and You Alone we ask for help"; and Tawhid al-Asma´ wa'l-Sifat, (Oneness of the Names and Attributes), which is to affirm the Attributes of Perfection for Allah, Most High, which He has affirmed for Himself and His Messenger has affirmed for Him, without ta`til (denying the Attributes), or tamthil and tashbih (likening the Attributes to creation) as is proven by His saying, "all praise and thanks" as already mentioned.</p>
                
                <p>It also affirms Prophethood in His saying "guide us to and on the Straight Path" because this guidance is not possible without a message. It affirms recompense for ones actions in His saying "Master of the Day of Judgement"" and it affirms that this recompense will be established upon justice, this is because the meaning of '"deen"' is recompense founded upon justice. It affirms Qadr (the divine decree) and that the slave is the true performer of his actions opposing the stances of the Qadariyyah, those who deny Qadr, and Jabariyyah, those who negate the will of the person. In fact this surah refutes all the people of innovation and misguidance in His saying "Guide us to and on the Straight Path" because this is knowing the truth and enacting it, and every innovator and misguided person contradicts this. It enjoins making the religion sincerely for Allah in terms of worship and seeking help in His saying "You Alone we worship and You Alone we ask for help".</p>
                
                <p>All praise and thanks are for Allah, Lord of everything that exists.</p>

                <p>"Allah- nothing deserves to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of all existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?! He knows what is presently before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursee extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not tire him. And He is the Most High, the Most Great".</p>
                
                <p><strong>(255)</strong> The Messenger of Allah -may Allah praise and send him peace- has stated that this verse is the greatest verse of the Qur'an due that which it comprises of Tawheed, completely singling out Allah, alone, without any partners, in all acts of worship and the many attributes of Allah, The Exalted Inventor of all things.</p>
                
                <p>Allah informs us that He is "Allah": Meaning, The One to whom belongs worship, in all its senses: None deserves to be worshiped except Him. Therefore, worshipping other than Allah is futile. He is "Al-Hayy" : The Ever-Living : To whom belongs all of the qualities of perfect life; including perfect hearing, vision, ability, will, and other attributes relating to His essence. He is "Al-Qayyoom" The Sustainer; it entails all of His attributes describing His actions. He is independent and free of any need of His creation. He sustains all of existence.</p>
                
                <p>He has originated everything into existence, has provided everything with sustenance, and all the necessities for existence and survival. Due to His perfect qualities of life and sustainment, "Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him". Drowsiness and sleep only occur in the creation, which experiences weakness, exhaustion, and inability, and does not apply to the One of Magnificence, Greatness, and Splendor! He informs us that He is The Owner of everything that is within the heavens and earth. So everything is a possessed slave of Allah: None can depart from this state. "There is none in the heavens and earth, except that it comes to the Most Merciful as a slave" (19:93). So He is The Owner of everything. And He is The One, to whom belongs the attributes of dominion, authority, reign, majesty, and management of universal affairs. Due to His supreme rule and authority, none can intercede with Him, except by His permission. All of the notable and distinguished interceders are slaves belonging to Him. None can proceed with intercession, until He permits them: "Say: To Allah belongs all intercession. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth…" (39:44). Allah does not allow anyone to intercede, except the intercession for whom He is pleased with. And Allah is not pleased, except with the one who worships Him alone and follows all of His Messengers. Therefore, whomsoever this does not apply to is not entitled any share of intercession. Then Allah informs us of His unlimited, all-encompassing knowledge. He knows what awaits the creation of infinite future events, as well as "what is behind them", of unlimited past affairs. No concealed thing is hidden from Him: "He knows that which deceives the eyes and what the hearts conceal" (40:19).</p>
                
                <p>None of the creation can encompass anything of Allah's knowledge and information, "except for what He wills", i.e., what He has disclosed to them, by different means, including prescribed and legislative affairs. Yet, this in its entirety, still amounts to nothing, with respect to the knowledge and information of The Inventor, Allah. This is affirmed by the most knowledgeable creations of Allah; the messengers and angels. They said: "Exalted are You! We have no knowledge, except what You have taught us" (2:32).</p>
                
                <p>Allah then informs us of His greatness and magnificence, and that "His footstool extends over the heavens and earth", and that He maintains the heavens and earth, and all of its inhabitants, by means of causation and universal orders, which He has placed in the creation. All of this, while; "its preservation does not tire or burden Him", due to the perfection of His greatness, ability, and His abundant wisdom in His laws. "And He is The Most High" The Most High in His essence; above all of His creation, having risen over the Throne. The Most High by the exaltedness and greatness of His attributes and status: To Him belongs every perfect attribute of excellence. The Most High by His subjugation of the creation: All of existence submits to Him. Even the stubborn and obstinate are subdued to His subjugation. And He is "The Most Great": He is the possessor of all the qualities of greatness, magnificence, nobility, and splendor: The One whom the hearts love, and the souls glorify. The hearts of His prophets, angels, and allies are in complete glorification of His Majesty.</p>
                
                <p>There is none greater than Him! Those of knowledge and acquaintance recognize that the greatness of anything and everything, even if it surpassed eminence and was considered indescribable, is still nothing compared to the greatness of The Most High, Most Great! Clearly, this verse, which is comprised of such extraordinary meanings, entitles it to be the greatest verse of the Qur'an. The heart of one who reads it in contemplation and reflection- while comprehending its meanings- deserves to be filled with certainty, acknowledgement, and Eemaan (Faith). Furthermore, by that, s/he will be safeguarded from the evil of Satan.</p>

                <p>In the Name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. <strong>1.</strong> When the earth is shaken with its [final] earthquake. <strong>2.</strong> And when the earth throws out all its contents. <strong>3.</strong> And people say: 'What is wrong with it?!' <strong>4.</strong> On that day it will report its news, <strong>5.</strong> Having been inspired by your Lord. <strong>6.</strong> On that day people will proceed in separate groups to be shown their deeds. <strong>7.</strong> So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it. <strong>8.</strong> And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(0-2)</strong> Allah informs us about what will happen on the Day of Rising, "when the earth is violently shaken," convulsing and rocking "with its final quake," flattening all buildings and structures, the mountains crumble and fall, and the hills are flattened. The earth's surface becomes like a barren, level plain on which you see neither dip nor gradient. "And when the earth throws out all its contents" the deceased and treasures lying within her.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(3)</strong> "and people say" when he sees the terror that has stricken it, exclaiming: "What is wrong with it?" what has happened?!</p>
                
                <p><strong>(4-5)</strong> "On that Day it" the earth "will report its news" bearing witness against people for the good and evil they have done on its surface. The earth is one of the witnesses that will be brought forward on the Day of Rising to testify for or against people. That is "because your Lord had inspired her" ordered her to relate what was done on her surface and she will not disobey His command.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(6)</strong> "That day, people will come forward" to the Standing of the Day of Rising for Allah to judge them "in scattered groups" broken, disparate bands "to be shown their deeds" that Allah may show them what they worked of good and evil and that He may show them His recompense.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(7-8)</strong> "Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it"," this holds true for any good and any evil that was worked: if a person will see even an atoms weight and, moreover, be recompensed for it, then for sure he will see anything greater as well. Allah says, "On the Day that each self finds the good it did, and the evil it did, present there in front of it, it will wish there were an age between it and then, Allah advises you to beware of Him. Allah is Ever-Gentle with His slaves" (3:30)."</p>
                
                <p>This verse then contains strong encouragement towards performing good deeds, even if it be little, and discouragement from working evil even if it seems minor.</p>

                <p>In the Name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. <strong>1.</strong> By the horses that run, with panting breath. <strong>2.</strong> And the producers of sparks when striking. <strong>3.</strong> Launching raids at dawn. <strong>4.</strong> Stirring up clouds of dust. <strong>5.</strong> And penetrating into the heart of enemy lines! <strong>6.</strong> Surely people are ungrateful to their Lord. <strong>7.</strong> And they certainly attest to this. <strong>8.</strong> And they are truly extreme in their love of worldly gains. <strong>9.</strong> Do they not know that when the contents of the graves will be spilled out?! <strong>10.</strong> And the secrets of the hearts will be made known. <strong>11.</strong> Surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(1)</strong> Allah takes an oath by horses due to His splendid Signs and evident blessings that they contain; virtues recognized by everyone. Allah takes an oath by them when they are in a state in which they do not resemble other animals: "By the horses that run, with panting breath" running swiftly and powerfully "snorting" their exertion causes their breaths to come out in pants and snorts.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(2)</strong> "And the producers of sparks when striking" the strength of impact of their hooves on rock brought about by the speed of the charge causes sparks to fly.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(3)</strong> "Launching raids" against the enemy "at dawn," as this is generally when the raid is done.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(4-5)</strong> "stirring up clouds of dust" because of the speed of their charge "and penetrating into the heart of enemy lines!" they charged against.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(6)</strong> That which the oath is being taken for is "Truly people are ungrateful to their Lord" meaning that they are unwilling to spend that which Allah has made a must on them. People by nature do not freely fulfil their duties. Often, when they do fulfil them, they do not do them completely or go beyond what is required. Their nature is one of laziness and they lack the resolve to fulfil His duties; those related to both wealth and body. Except for those Allah has guided and they do not have this characteristic; rather, they fulfil the rights.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(7)</strong> "And he himself is a witness to this", meaning the human being to his lack of desire in fulfilling duties, he will not deny or reject this because it is evident. It is also possible that the personal pronoun refers to Allah, Most High, i.e. "He (Allah) is a witness to that". This is a severe warning and threat for those who are not grateful to their Lord while He is a witness of this.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(8)</strong> "And they" human beings "are truly extreme in their love of worldly gains"," it is this love that has led them to abandon fulfilling His obligations. They have given precedence to the lusts of their soul over the good-pleasure of their Lord. This is due to them focusing their attention in this world while they are heedless of the Next Life.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(9)</strong> It is for this reason that Allah says, directing his attention to the Promised Day so that he may fear it, "Do they not know" these deceived "that when the contents of the graves will be spilled out?!" the dead are taken out of the graves, resurrected and gathered "and the secrets of the hearts will be made known" …</p>
                
                <p>Whatever they contained of good and evil is made known: secrets become open and the concealed become apparent. The end result of deeds will be plainly seen on the people's faces.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(11)</strong> "Surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day"," their outer and inner deeds, the minor and major, and He will recompense them for them. Even though Allah is perfectly informed about them on every day, this Day has specifically been mentioned to highlight that those deeds will be fully recompensed since Allah is fully aware of them.</p>

                <p>In the Name of Allah, The Entirely Merciful, The Especially Merciful. <strong>1.</strong> The striking Hour i.e. the Day of Resurrection. <strong>2.</strong> What is the striking Hour? <strong>3.</strong> And what will make you know what the striking Hour is? <strong>4.</strong> It is the Day people will be like scattered moths, <strong>5.</strong> And the mountains will be like carded wool, <strong>6.</strong> So as for those whose scale is heavy with good deeds, <strong>7.</strong> He will live the most pleasant life in Paradise <strong>8.</strong> And as for those whose scale is light, <strong>9.</strong> He will have his home in Hell. <strong>10.</strong> And what will make you realize what that is? <strong>11.</strong> It is a hot blazing Fire!</p>
                
                <p><strong>(1-3)</strong> "The Striking Hour" is one of the names given to the Day of Judgment. It is called so because its horrors strike and disturb people with fear. It is for this reason that Allah stressed its gravity and severity by asking, "What is the striking Hour? And what will make you know what the striking Hour is?"</p>
                
                <p><strong>(4)</strong> "It is a day people will be…" due to fear and horror, "like scattered moths", like scattered locusts, randomly running into each other, not knowing where they are going. Then, when a fire is lit, they rush straight into it, unable to perceive its danger. On that Day, despite people being rational creatures, this will be their state.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(5)</strong> As for the firm, mighty mountains, then they will be like carded wool," feeble and of such weight that the least gust of wind cause them to flutter away. Allah says, "And you see the mountains that you deem solid flying with the flight of clouds" (27:88)." Then, the mountains shall become like scattered dust, and no perceivable trace of them will remain. Then, the Scale will be erected and people will be divided into two categories: the happy and the wretched.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(6-7)</strong> So as for those whose scale is heavy with good deeds," i.e. his good deeds outweigh his bad "they will live the most pleasant life in Paradise," in the Gardens of Bliss.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(8-11)</strong> "But as for those whose scales are light", whose good deeds do not compare to his bad "they will have their home in Hell", his abode and final destination. It will be like a mother to him who always sticks close to him just as Allah says, "surely the punishment in it is lasting and clinging" (25:65). It is also said that the meaning is that his mind will be hurled into Hellfire, meaning that he will be thrown into Hell headfirst. "What will make you realize what it is?!" asked by way of emphasizing its severity, then the answer is given: "a hot blazing Fire", seventy times hotter than the fire of this world! We seek Allah's protection from it!</p>

                <p><strong>1.</strong> Competition for more worldly gains diverts you from Allah. <strong>2.</strong> until you end up in your graves. <strong>3.</strong> But no! You will soon come to know. <strong>4.</strong> Again, no! You will soon come to know. <strong>5.</strong> No! If you only knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have occupied yourselves in worldly things). <strong>6.</strong> You will surely see the Hellfire. <strong>7.</strong> Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty. <strong>8.</strong> Then, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about your worldly pleasures.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(1)</strong> Allah reprimands His slaves for being distracted from the purpose of their creation: worshipping Him alone without any partners, knowing Him, turning to Him in repentance, and giving preference to what He loves over everything else. "Diverts you" away from that which was mentioned, "Competition for more worldly gains" exactly what worldly gains are being referred to has been left unmentioned so as to include everything that people pile up and take pride in wealth, children, helpers, armies, servants, status and the likes: everything, whose goal is not Allah's face, that one person seeks to surpass another in distracts you from your purpose.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(2)</strong> Your idle pastime and state of heedlessness will continue "until you end up in your graves"," when the veil of negligence will be lifted from you; but then it will be too late to do anything! His saying "until you end up in your graves" proves that the Barzakh, the life of the grave, is a wayfaring post whose purpose is to pass one on his way to the Abode of the Hereafter. This is because Allah called the deceased in their graves visitors, and did not call them residents. This then directs the person's attention to the Resurrection and the recompense for deeds in an Abode that is eternal.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(3-6)</strong> It is for this reason that Allah proceeds to threaten them with His words, "But no! You will soon come to know. Again, no! You will soon come to know. No! If you only knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have occupied yourselves in worldly things)" i.e. if you knew what lies before you with a knowledge that penetrates the heart, competition would not have distracted you; instead you would have rushed to work righteous deeds.</p>
                
                <p>However, the absence of true knowledge has led to that which you are witnessing, "You will surely see the Hellfire" you will witness the Rising and you will see the Hell which is prepared for the disbelievers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(7)</strong> "Then you will see it with the eye of certainty"," with the physical eye, as Allah says, ""The evildoers will see the Fire and realize they are going to fall into it and find no way of escaping from it" (18:53).</p>
                
                <p><strong>(8)</strong> "Then, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about your worldly pleasures", in this world. Did you show Him due gratitude? Did you fulfil the rights of Allah in this world and not use his blessings to disobey Him? If so He will confer upon you a blessing far greater and better. Were you deceived by this world and abandoned due gratitude? If so, Allah will punish you: "On the Day when those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire: You dissipated the good things you had in your worldly life and enjoyed yourself in it. So today you are being repaid with the punishment of humiliation for being arrogant in the earth without any right and for being deviators"(46:20).</p>

                <p><strong>(1-3)</strong> Allah takes an oath by time, the passage of night and day, the time in which man works his deeds: "By the time", the purpose of the oath being "Truly man is in a state of loss", loss has many different levels: complete loss, the state of one who loses both this world and the Hereafter, who loses eternal bliss and instead deserves Hell. A person could also lose out in some aspects and not others and this is why Allah generalizes this loss to all people except those who have four qualities:</p>
                
                <p>-Those who believe in what Allah has ordered to believe in, faith cannot come about or be complete without knowledge and therefore it is a branch of knowledge.</p>
                
                <p>- And "do good works," all good deeds, outward and inward, those linked to the rights of Allah and the rights of His slaves, both the obligatory and recommended</p>
                
                <p>- And "counsel one another to the truth" which is faith and righteous deeds</p>
                
                <p>- "And counsel one another to patience" in obedience to Allah, away from disobedience to Him, and in the face of His decrees that man finds painful. The first two matters perfect the person and the next two aid to perfect others. In the completion of these four matters lies safety from loss and through them does the person attain success.</p>

Then it is explained, "It is Allah's kindled Fire", whose fuel is men and stones which, because of its extreme intensity "rages over the hearts"," piercing their bodies and scorching their very hearts.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(8-9)</strong> "It will be sealed over them", It closes in on them from every side, "In columns" caging them in towering columns, behind its doors "extended" preventing them from leaving; "Whenever they try to get out, they will be brought back into it, and it will be said to them: 'Taste the chastisement of the Fire which you used to deny' "(32:20).

And He sent against them flocks of birds", one after another, "Striking them with stones of hard clay", striking every single one of them, weakening them, wearing them down and finally killing them, "And made them like an empty field of stalks of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle". Allah sufficed against their evil and utterly confounded their plot. Their story is well known and famous. This event occurred in the year that the Messenger of Allahصلى الله عليه وسلم was born, and became one of the miracles prior to his call and one of the clear proofs of his message. To Allah belongs all praise and thanks.</p>

                <p><strong>(1-4)</strong> Many of the scholars who have explained this verse have stated that this section of the chapter continues on from the previous chapter. In this case the meaning would be 'We did what We did to the people of the elephant for Quraysh, their safety, their benefit, and so that their winter and summer caravans to Yemen and Syria continue as they are, bearing profit. Allah destroyed those who wished to harm them; He magnified the standing of the Sanctified House and raised the status of its inhabitants in the hearts of the Arabs such that they held those who lived around it in great respect. Moreover, He did not stop them from undertaking any journey they wished.</p>
                
                <p>It is for these reasons that He ordered them to show Him gratitude by saying, "so let them worship the Lord of this House", let them single Him out alone for worship and direct their worship to Him and Him alone. "Who has fed them against hunger and has secured them from fear", being able to eat freely and living in safety are two of the greatest worldly blessings which call for gratitude to Allah, Most High. O Allah! All praise and thanks are Yours for Your blessings, the outer and inner! Allah specifically mentions that He is the Lord of the House because of its nobility and excellence. Whereas in reality, He is the Lord of everything.</p>

                <p>In the Name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful <strong>1.</strong> Have you seen the one who denies the religion? <strong>2.</strong> That is the one who repulses the orphan, <strong>3.</strong> And does not encourage the feeding of the poor. <strong>4.</strong> So woe to those hypocrites who pray <strong>5.</strong> Yet are unmindful of their prayers; <strong>6.</strong> Those who show off, <strong>7.</strong> And refuse to give even the simplest aid.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(1)</strong> Allah, the Most High, criticizes those who do not fulfil His rights nor the rights of His slaves by saying "Have you seen the one who denies the religion", by denying the resurrection and the recompense and as such does not believe in what the Messengers came with.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2)</strong> "That is the one who repulses the orphan" with coarseness and insolence. He shows him no mercy because of the hardness of his heart and because he does not look to reward, nor fear punishment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(3)</strong> "And does not encourage" others "the feeding of the poor", not to mention him, himself feeding them!</p>
                
                <p><strong>(4-5)</strong> "So woe to those hypocrites who pray" they pray but "are unmindful of their prayers" lax in its performance, not praying in its correct time and skipping its pillars. This is because they do not give the commandments of Allah due regard; they wasted the prayer which is the most important act of obedience. Heedlessness of the prayer is what leads to censure and blame. However to have some sort of forgetfulness in the prayer is something that happens to everyone, even the Prophet– may Allah praise and send him peace-.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(6-7)</strong> It was to express this fact that Allah describes them as showing off, hard of heart and without mercy: "Those who show off" i.e. they work their deeds by to show off "and refuse to give even the simplest aid" they forbid giving small things that would not harm them at all, essentials such as a cup or bowl or the likes which are habitually given away without the giver feeling any remorse at their loss. These people, because of their intense greed, prevent even these being given let alone larger, more significant things!</p>
                
                <p>This chapter encourages the feeding of the poor and the orphan, it encourages the encouragement of this, it stresses the importance of being careful in our prayers, the importance of preserving them, the importance of being sincere in them, and in all other deeds. The chapter also encourages doing good and spending small amounts of wealth in charity because Allah reprimands those who do not do this. Allah, the Perfect One, knows best.</p>

                <p><strong>(1)</strong> Allah, the Most High, says to His Prophet Muhammad- may Allah praise and send him peace- consolidating him "We have granted you O Prophet abundant goodness"; meaning, a lot of good and great virtues from among them the river which Allah has prepared for His Prophet on the Day of Judgement called Al-Kawthar. Also the Hawd whose length is a month traveling and its width is likewise a month traveling, its color is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, its cups are like the stars in the sky in their number and illumination; whoever drinks from it will never get thirsty after!</p>
                
                <p><strong>(2)</strong> Once Allah reminds the Prophet of the blessings, He orders him to be thankful for them saying "So pray and sacrifice to your Lord alone". He has specifically mentioned these two acts of worship since they are the best acts of worship and the most noble of actions to draw closer to Allah. Moreover, the prayer comprises of submission of heart and limbs to Allah and takes one through various types of veneration or servitude. Sacrificing is drawing closer to Allah with the best sacrifice the slave can offer and spending the wealth which the souls love and are stingy about.</p>
                
                <p><strong>(3)</strong> "Only the one who hates you", criticizes you, and does not give you your rights "is truly cut off from every good", prevented from all good; prevented from good deeds and prevented from being remembered. As for Muhammad – may Allah praise and send him peace- then he is truly complete; as complete as any created being can ever be in terms of being remembered or mentioned as well as having numerous helpers and followers.</p>

                    <div class="ayah-translation">6. "To you be your religion, and to me my religion (Islâmic Monotheism)."<br><span class="translator">— Al-Hilali &amp; Khan</span></div>
                    <a href="https://quran.com/109/6" target="_blank" class="ayah-link">🔗 https://quran.com/109/6</a>
                </div>
                
                <p>In the Name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. <strong>1.</strong> Say, "O disbelievers, <strong>2.</strong> I do not worship what you worship. <strong>3.</strong> Nor do you worship the One I worship. <strong>4.</strong> I will never worship what you worship, <strong>5.</strong> Nor will you ever worship the One I worship. <strong>5.</strong> You have your religion, and I have my religion".</p>
                
                <p><strong>(1-6)</strong> Meaning, say to those who choose not to believe openly and clearly that "I do not worship what you worship" meaning one frees from that which they used to worship besides Allah openly and secretly. "Nor do you worship the One I worship" since you do not worship Allah alone. So you worshiping Him along with others is not considered worship. He repeated this phrase so the first one shows that the deed does not exist while the second one shows that it has now become their attribute. For this reason He differentiated between the two groups and separated between them by saying "You have your religion, and I have my religion". Similarly, Allah has said: ''Say, 'everyone works according to his way" (17:84); I free myself from your actions and you free yourselves from my deeds.</p>
